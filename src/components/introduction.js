          In a previous life, I lived in Europe working in kitchens. I am extremely thankful for this experience. This employment  gave me the opportunity to work with people of all backgrounds, greatly improving my ability to work in teams and my understanding of communication both verbally and non-verbally.

          As a junior developer I am looking for a role where I am in the best position to learn and develop my programming skills

        <p>
          Programming is an unknown mysterious world to me, but within this mystery are possibilities to create and influence the world around me. I aim to combine my education in technology with my interest in renewable energy. I am passionate about creating cleaner air, oceans and land, I will always look for opportunities to help create this environmental change.
